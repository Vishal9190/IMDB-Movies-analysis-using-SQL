# Marketing Click Through Rate Analytics


   ## Project Goals
   CoolTShirts sells shirts of all kinds, as long as they are T-shaped and cool. Recently, CTS started a few marketing campaigns to increase website visits and purchases. Using touch attribution, they‚Äôd like to map their customers‚Äô journey: from initial visit to purchase. They can use that information to optimize their marketing campaigns.I tried to answer following questions with sql query.
   
   - How many campaigns and sources does CoolTShirts use? Which source is used for each campaign?
   - What pages are on the CoolTShirts website?
   - How many first touches is each campaign responsible for?
   - How many last touches is each campaign responsible for?
   - How many visitors make a purchase?
   - How many last touches on the purchase page is each campaign responsible for?
   - CoolTShirts can re-invest in 5 campaigns. Given your findings in the project, which should they pick and why?
